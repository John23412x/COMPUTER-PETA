<h2><center>EDUCATION CRISIS</h2></center>

<p>"Ang Kabataan ang Pag-asa ng Bayan" is the quote from none other than Dr. Jose Rizal that we're probably hearing since then. 
But how can we experience the life that we want to have if our only hope doesn't even have one? First and foremost, what is the education crisis? First and foremost, what is education crisis? The word "education crisis" often refers to a situation in which the education system is facing severe problems or challenges that might have negative impacts on learners, teachers, and society as a whole. 
The education crisis has become a burden to us as a result of a lack of funds, weak administration in our country, and COVID-19. Regardless of the hope it gives us that we can still learn even if there is a pandemic, we will never be able to avoid the bad consequences that have completely affected our lives. 
The COVID-19 reduces individuals' opportunity to acquire the knowledge and abilities required to participate in the workforce and contribute to society, as evidenced by the survey. Hopefully, this will be our lesson or guide to lending an ear to our "hope," the youths. We need to hear the voices of the youth in order to have a better country. Just like Taylor Swift said, "When you are young, they assume you know nothing," but no one is too young to make a change for our country. As we end this, I would like to encourage the government to listen before it's too late to make a change.	</p>
