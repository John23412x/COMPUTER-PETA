<h2><center>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2></center>
<p>Climate change describes significant and ongoing alterations to the Earth's climate such as temperature, weather patterns, and precipitation have all changed during the past century, and this movement is predicted to continue into the next. Human activities such as burning deforestation, fossil fuels, and industrial operations, which lead to greater atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, are the primary causes of climate change. 
Rising sea levels are more frequent and severe extreme weather events, changes in ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as detrimental effects on human health and socioeconomic systems, are all results of climate change. 
Urgent action is needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and make the switch to cleaner, and much sustainable energy sources in order to lessen the effects of climate change. 
It is essential for individuals, governments, and organizations to take collective action to address climate change and ensure a sustainable future for our planet.</p>
