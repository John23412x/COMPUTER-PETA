Inflation: What is it? Have you noticed that your monthly grocery expenses seem to be rising? Ever notice how the cost of goods and services seems to be rising steadily? This is due to inflation, which is the general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. Inflation is a phenomenon that can have a big impact on people's lives and the economy as a whole. Imagine attempting to plan your family's monthly expenses only to discover that the cost of goods and services keeps going up. Given the Philippines' rising inflation rate, this is a reality for many Filipinos. The sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time is referred to as inflation in economics. This implies that as the cost of goods and services rises, so does the purchasing power of money.

Have you ever figured out why your allowance doesn't cover your needs? For students, inflation is a serious concern. It is the cause of the constant rise in tuition costs, the price of textbooks, and the cost of supplies. Students may find it difficult to cover these costs, particularly if they are already having financial difficulties. Also, if inflation causes the cost of living, such as rent and food, to rise, students could have to spend a greater portion of their salary on these essentials, leaving them with less money to devote to their education or other important pursuits.
For students, inflation can be a burden since it can increase the price of their education and living expenses while lowering the purchasing power of their salary. Students may find it more challenging to finance the necessities for both their academic and financial success as a result. Furthermore, because the interest rates on student loans may rise in tandem with inflation, inflation may have an impact on them as well. This implies that long-term costs for students could increase, making it more challenging for them to manage their money and repay their loans.
In general, inflation can be a problem for students because it can make it more difficult for them to afford the education and materials they need to achieve their goals and because it may lead to long-term financial difficulties that are challenging to overcome.
Inflation can easily affect students since most prices of supplies doesn't fit in their budget. It causes students' to lose money supply, which means they may need to spend more to maintain the same cost of living. Since many students rely on loans to pay for their education, inflation may force them to take on more debt once they graduate. As unemployment rates increase as a result of inflation, it may become more expensive for students to attend school.
