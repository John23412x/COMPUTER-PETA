<h2><center>POVERTY</h2></center>

<p>Based on World Bank estimates, learning poverty in the Philippines is at 90.9 percent as of June 2022. This means that almost 9 out of 10 Filipino children aged 10 years old and above are unable to read and understand a simple text. Poverty can have a significant impact on access to education in the Philippines, as many families cannot afford school fees or basic supplies for their children. Poverty can also lead to malnutrition and poor health, which can affect a child's ability to learn and succeed in school. This can result in lower enrollment rates and higher dropout rates, limiting individual opportunities and preventing the country's development. Poverty in the Philippines is perhaps the most major issue that the public authority should prioritize. Investing in education can lead to better opportunities for individuals while also contributing to the overall development of the Philippines.</p>
